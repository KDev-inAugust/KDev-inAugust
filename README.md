### Hello! ðŸ’«

Thanks for visiting. <br>
I'm a software engineer with a background in Web Development. <br>
I have a lot of experience working in creative teams and generating deliverables, I am good at project planning and proposals, and I always appreciate feedback.<br>

My favorite thing about coding and engineering is bringing an idea to life so that it can be useful to others, I also feel that the sharing nature of much of the development community exemplifies this. 

Currently my favorite languages and frameworks include: <br>

- JavaScript
- React
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Active Record and Active Storage
- PostgreSQL
- CSS as well as Tailwind
- Typescript



âœ’ I have a [blog](https://kms-strategies.ghost.io) you can have a look at to get a sense of how I think about some of the basic techniques I learned while studying development.

ðŸ–¥ you can also have a look at my ==> [Portfolio Site](https://www.kmsoundstrategies.com/dev/) for examples of my work. You will find video walkthroughs of Web Apps I have concepted, designed,  and created, from the ground up.

 ðŸŽ¹ when I am not coding I enjoy making music and reading. 
 
 **Fun Fact**: I have studied music on 4 different continents over the course of my life. <br>
 **Fun Fact 2**: I started coding during a year long work trip where I had to be available only at night so I spent all morning, afternoon, and early evening learning. I typed my first "hello world!" from a hotel in Los Angeles. 
 
 Thanks For Visiting!<br>
