### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting. <br>
I'm a software engineer with a background in Web Development. <br>


Currently my favorite languages and frameworks include: <br>

- Javascript
- React
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Active Record and Active Storage
- PostgreSQL

âœ’ I have a [blog](https://kms-strategies.ghost.io) you can have a look at to get a sense of how I think about some of the basic techniques I learned while studying development.

ðŸ–¥ you can also have a look at my ==> [Portfolio Site](https://www.kmsoundstrategies.com/dev/) for examples of my work. You will find video walkthroughs of Web Apps I have concepted, designed,  and created, from the ground up.

ðŸŽ¹ when I am not coding I enjoy making music
